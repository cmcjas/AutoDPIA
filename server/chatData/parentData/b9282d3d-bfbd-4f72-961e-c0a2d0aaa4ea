They give background on the reasoning for the high-risk indicators, and examples of processing likely to result in high risk.\nIn most cases, a combination of two of these factors indicates the need for a DPIA. However, this is not a strict rule.\nYou may be able to justify a decision not to carry out a DPIA if you are confident that the processing is nevertheless unlikely to result in a high risk, but you should document your reasons.\nOn the other hand, in some cases you may need to do a DPIA if only one factor is present  and it is good practice to do so.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "chatData"}, "type": "Document"}}
