This is because using such technology can involve novel forms of data collection and use, possibly with a high risk to individuals rights and freedoms. The personal and social consequences of deploying a new technology may be unknown, and a DPIA can help the controller to understand a control such risks.\nExamples of processing using innovative technology include:\n* artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning;\n* connected and autonomous vehicles;\n* intelligent transport systems;\n* smart technologies (including wearables);\n* market research involving neuro-measurement (e.g. emotional response analysis and brain activity);\n* some internet of things applications, depending on the specific circumstances of the processing.\nIt is not just cutting-edge technology that might be classed as innovative. If a controller implements existing technology in a new way, this could result in high risks that, unless a DPIA is done, may not be identified and dealt with. For example, doing a DPIA as part of a project to design and deploy a large-scale database system that processes customer details could:\n* help in deciding what proportionate security measures should be implemented (e.g. protective monitoring);\n* and act as a reminder that UKGDPR-compliant contracts need to be in place with any processors.\nThe ICO list of high-risk processing operations requires a DPIA if your processing involves innovative technology in combination with another criterion from the European guidelines (e.g. evaluation or scoring, or sensitive data).", "metadata": {"doc_id": "chatData"}, "type": "Document"}}
