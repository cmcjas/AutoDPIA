You may decide that some risks, and even a high risk, are acceptable given the benefits of the processing and the difficulties of mitigation. However, if there is still a high risk, you need to consult the ICO before you can go ahead with the processing.\nAs part of the sign-off process, you should seek and document DPO advice on whether the processing is compliant and can go ahead. If you decide not to follow their advice, you need to record your reasons.\nYou should also record any reasons for going against the views of individuals or other consultees.\nWhat happens next?\nYou must integrate the outcomes of your DPIA into your project plans. You should identify any action points and who is responsible for implementing them. You can use the usual project-management process to ensure these are followed through.\nYou should monitor the ongoing performance of the DPIA. You may need to cycle through the process again before your plans are finalised.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "chatData"}, "type": "Document"}}
