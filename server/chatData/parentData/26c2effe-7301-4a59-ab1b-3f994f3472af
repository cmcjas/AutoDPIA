It should include these steps:\n* Step 1: identify the need for a DPIA\n* Step 2: describe the processing\n* Step 3: consider consultation\n* Step 4: assess necessity and proportionality\n* Step 5: identify and assess risks\n* Step 6: identify measures to mitigate the risks\n* Step 7: sign off and record outcomes\nAfter sign-off you should integrate the outcomes from your DPIA back into your project plan, and keep your DPIA under review. Throughout this process, you should consult individuals and other stakeholders as needed.\nThe DPIA process is designed to be flexible and scalable. You can design a process that fits with your existing approach to managing risks and projects, as long as it contains these key elements.\nYou can also scale the time and resources needed for a DPIA to fit the nature of the project. It does not need to be a time-consuming process in every case.\nIs there a template we can use?\nYou can use or adapt oursample DPIA templateif you wish.\nYou dont have to use this template. You can make your own to suit your needs, or use an existing project-management method, as long as it covers all the key elements of the process. If you are making your own template, you may find it helpful to refer to theCriteria for an acceptable DPIAin Annex 2 of the Article 29 working party guidelines.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "chatData"}, "type": "Document"}}
