Article 35 says that a DPIA must consider risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. This includes risks to privacy and data protection rights, but also effects on other fundamental rights and interests.\nThe key provision here is Recital 75, which links risk to the concept of potential harm or damage to individuals:\nThe risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, of varying likelihood and severity, may result from data processing which could lead to physical, material or non-material damage, in particular: where the processing may give rise to discrimination, identity theft or fraud, financial loss, damage to the reputation, loss of confidentiality of personal data protected by professional secrecy, unauthorised reversal of pseudonymisation, or any other significant economic or social disadvantage; where data subjects might be deprived of their rights and freedoms or prevented from exercising control over their personal data\nThe focus is therefore on any potential harm to individuals. However, the risk-based approach is not just about actual damage and should also look at the possibility for more intangible harm. It includes any significant economic or social disadvantage.\nThe impact on society as a whole may also be a relevant risk factor. For example, it may be a significant risk if your intended processing leads to a loss of public trust.\nA DPIA must assess the level of risk, and in particular whether it is high risk. The UK GDPR is clear that assessing the level of risk involves looking at both the likelihood and the severity of the potential harm.", "type": "Document"}}
