The processing is invisible because the individual is unaware that you are collecting and using their personal data, even if you publish a privacy notice on your website.\nThis processing results in a risk to the individuals interests as they cannot exercise any control over your use of their data. In particular, they are unable to use their data protection rights if they are unaware of the processing. This is true even if the processing itself is unlikely to have any negative effect.\nYou may also be at risk of breaching the fairness and transparency requirements of the first data protection principle if the processing, or any outcome from it, may not be reasonably foreseen by the individual.\nFor these reasons, processing in this way is only permitted by the UKGDPR in limited circumstances. These include where to provide the privacy information provesimpossibleor would involve adisproportionate effort.\nCircumstances when it is impossible to provide privacy will only arise rarely, for example where you have no contact details for individuals and have no reasonable means of obtaining them.\nIt is important that you can demonstrate compliance with individuals right to be informed. So, if you are proposing processing operations that involve the use of data obtained from third parties, you must first carefully consider whether you can provide privacy information to the individuals. If you intend to rely on the exception for disproportionate effort, you must be able to justify this, and you must take other measures to protect peoples rights.
