However, if you decide this is not appropriate, you should record this decision as part of your DPIA, with a clear explanation. For example, you may be able to demonstrate that consultation would compromise commercial confidentiality, undermine security, or be disproportionate or impracticable.\nIf the DPIA covers the processing of personal data of existing contacts (for example, existing customers or employees), you should design a consultation process to seek the views of those particular individuals, or their representatives.\nIf the DPIA covers a plan to collect the personal data of individuals you have not yet identified, you may need to carry out a more general public- consultation process, or targeted research. This could take the form of market research with a certain demographic or contacting relevant campaign or consumer groups for their views.\nIf your DPIA decision differs from the views of individuals, you need to document your reasons for disregarding their views.\nStep 3: Do we need to consult anyone else?\nIf you use a data processor, you may need to ask them for information and assistance. Your contracts with processors should require them to assist.\nYou should consult all relevant internal stakeholders, in particular anyone with responsibility for information security.\nWe also recommend you consider seeking legal advice or advice from other independent experts such as IT experts, sociologists or ethicists where appropriate. However, there are no specific requirements to do so.", "type": "Document"}}
