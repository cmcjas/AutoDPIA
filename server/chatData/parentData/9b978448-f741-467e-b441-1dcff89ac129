An external change to the wider context of the processing should also prompt you to review your DPIA. For example, if a new security flaw is identified, new technology is made available, or a new public concern is raised over the type of processing you do or the vulnerability of a particular group of data subjects.\nWhat kind of risk do they assess?\nThere is no explicit definition of risk in the UK GDPR, but the various provisions on DPIAs make clear that this is about the risks to individuals interests. Article 35 says that a DPIA must consider risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. This includes risks to privacy and data protection rights, but also effects on other fundamental rights and interests.\nThe key provision here is Recital 75, which links risk to the concept of potential harm or damage to individuals:\nThe risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, of varying likelihood and severity, may result from data processing which could lead to physical, material or non-material damage, in particular: where the processing may give rise to discrimination, identity theft or fraud, financial loss, damage to the reputation, loss of confidentiality of personal data protected by professional secrecy, unauthorised reversal of pseudonymisation, or any other significant economic or social disadvantage; where data subjects might be deprived of their rights and freedoms or prevented from exercising control over their personal data\nThe focus is therefore on any potential harm to individuals. However, the risk-based approach is not just about actual damage and should also look at the possibility for more intangible harm. It includes any significant economic or social disadvantage.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "chatData"}, "type": "Document"}}
