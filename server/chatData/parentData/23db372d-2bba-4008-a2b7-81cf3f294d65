You may even be able to rely on an existing DPIA if it covered a similar processing operation with similar risks. A group of controllers can also do a joint DPIA for a group project or industry-wide initiative.\nFor new technologies, you may be able to use a DPIA done by the product developer to inform your own DPIA on your implementation plans.\nYou can use an effective DPIA throughout the development and implementation of a project or proposal, embedded into existing project management or other organisational processes.\nFor new projects, DPIAs are a vital part of data protection by design. They build in data protection compliance at an early stage, when there is most scope for influencing how the proposal is developed and implemented.\nHowever, its important to remember that DPIAs are also relevant if you are planning to make changes to an existing system. In this case you must ensure that you do the DPIA at a point when there is a realistic opportunity to influence those plans. Recital 84 of the UK GDPR is clear that:\nthe outcome of the assessment should be taken into account when determining the appropriate measures to be taken in order to demonstrate that the processing of personal data complies with this Regulation.\nIn other words, a DPIA is not simply a rubber stamp or a technicality as part of a sign-off process. Its vital to integrate the outcomes of your DPIA back into your project plan.\nYou should not view a DPIA as a one-off exercise to file away. A DPIA is a living process to help you manage and review the risks of the processing and the measures you've put in place on an ongoing basis. You need to keep it under review and reassess if anything changes.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "chatData"}, "type": "Document"}}
