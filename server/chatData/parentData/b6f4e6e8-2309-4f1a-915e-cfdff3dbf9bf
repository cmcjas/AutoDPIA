If you have any major project that involves the use of personal data, it is good practice to do a DPIA. If you already intend to do a DPIA, go straight to step 2.\nOtherwise, you need to check whether your processing is on the list of types of processing that automatically require a DPIA. If not, you need to screen for other factors that may indicate it is a type of processing that is likely to result in high risk, such as processing the data of vulnerable individuals.\nYou can use or adapt thechecklistsat the end of this guidance to help you do this screening. You can also read When do we need to do a DPIA?for more guidance.\nIf you do this screening and decide a DPIA is not needed, you should document your decision and the reasons for it, including your DPOs advice. This does not have to be a burdensome paperwork exercise. It just needs to help you demonstrate you have properly considered and complied with your DPIA obligations. For example, you could simply keep an annotated copy of the checklist.\nIf you are in any doubt, we strongly recommend you do a DPIA.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "chatData"}, "type": "Document"}}
