However, the important point here is not whether the processing is actually high risk or likely to result in harm  that is the job of the DPIA itself to assess in detail. Instead, the question is a more high-level screening test: are there features which point to the potential for high risk? You are screening for any red flags which indicate that you need to do a DPIA to look at the risk (including the likelihood and severity of potential harm) in more detail.\nArticle 35(3) lists three examples of types of processing that automatically requires a DPIA, and the ICO has published a list under Article 35(4) setting out ten more. There are alsoEuropean guidelineswith some criteria to help you identify other likely high risk processing.\nThis does not mean that these types of processing are always high risk, or are always likely to cause harm  just that there is a reasonable chance they may be high risk and so a DPIA is required to assess the level of risk in more detail.\nIf your intended processing is not described under UKGDPR, Article 35(3) the ICO list or European guidelines then ultimately, its up to you to decide whether your processing is of a type likely to result in high risk, taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing. If in any doubt, we would always recommend that you do a DPIA to ensure compliance and encourage best practice.\nWhat types of processing automatically require a DPIA?\nArticle 35(3) sets out three types of processing which always require a DPIA:\n1. Systematic and extensive profiling with significant effects:\n(a) any systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating to natural persons which is based on automated processing, including profiling, and on which decisions are based that produce legal effects concerning the natural person or similarly significantly affect the natural person.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "chatData"}, "type": "Document"}}
