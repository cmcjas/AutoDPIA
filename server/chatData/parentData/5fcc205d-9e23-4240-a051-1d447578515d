This may not always be clear. So in the absence of any clear and authoritative statement on whether such an assessment was done, we recommend you err on the side of caution and do a DPIA to ensure you consider how best to mitigate any high risk.\n* You have already done a substantially similar DPIA. You need to be confident that you can demonstrate that the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing are all similar.\n* The ICO issues a list of processing operations which do not require a DPIA.We have the power to establish this type of list, but we have not done so yet. We may consider a list in future in the light of our experience of how the DPIA provisions are being interpreted in practice.", "type": "Document"}}
