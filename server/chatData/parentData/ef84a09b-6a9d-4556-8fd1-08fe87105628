It should include these steps:\n* Step 1: identify the need for a DPIA\n* Step 2: describe the processing\n* Step 3: consider consultation\n* Step 4: assess necessity and proportionality\n* Step 5: identify and assess risks\n* Step 6: identify measures to mitigate the risks\n* Step 7: sign off and record outcomes\nAfter sign-off you should integrate the outcomes from your DPIA back into your project plan, and keep your DPIA under review. Throughout this process, you should consult individuals and other stakeholders as needed.\nThe DPIA process is designed to be flexible and scalable. You can design a process that fits with your existing approach to managing risks and projects, as long as it contains these key elements.\nYou can also scale the time and resources needed for a DPIA to fit the nature of the project. It does not need to be a time-consuming process in every case.\nIs there a template we can use?\nYou can use or adapt oursample DPIA templateif you wish.\nYou dont have to use this template. You can make your own to suit your needs, or use an existing project-management method, as long as it covers all the key elements of the process. If you are making your own template, you may find it helpful to refer to theCriteria for an acceptable DPIAin Annex 2 of the Article 29 working party guidelines.\n\nWho is responsible for the DPIA?\nYou can decide who has responsibility for carrying out DPIAs in your organisation, and who signs them off. You can outsource your DPIA, but you remain responsible for it. If you have a Data Protection Officer (DPO), you must ask for their advice on your DPIA, and document it as part of the process.\nYou may want to ask a processor to carry out a DPIA on your behalf if they do the relevant processing operation, but again you remain responsible for it.\nWho should be involved in the DPIA?\nAs well as the business area or individual who is leading on the project or process requiring the DPIA, you should also involve:\n* a DPO, if you have one;\n* information security staff;\n* any processors; and\n* legal advisors or other experts, where relevant.", "type": "Document"}}
