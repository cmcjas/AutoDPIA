In particular, look at whether the processing could contribute to:\n* inability to exercise rights (including but not limited to privacy rights);\n* inability to access services or opportunities;\n* loss of control over the use of personal data;\n* discrimination;\n* identity theft or fraud;\n* financial loss;\n* reputational damage;\n* physical harm;\n* loss of confidentiality;\n* re-identification of pseudonymised data; or\n* any other significant economic or social disadvantage\nYou should include an assessment of the security risks, including sources of risk and the potential impact of each type of breach (including illegitimate access to, modification of or loss of personal data).\nTo assess whether the risk is a high risk, you need to consider both the likelihood and severity of the possible harm. Harm does not have to be inevitable to qualify as a risk or a high risk. It must be more than remote, but any significant possibility of very serious harm may still be enough to qualify as a high risk. Equally, a high probability of widespread but more minor harm may still count as high risk.\nYou must make an objective assessment of the risks. It is helpful to use a 3x3 structured matrix to think about likelihood and severity of risks:\n{\n    \"severity_of_impact\": {\n        \"serious_harm\": {\n            \"remote\": \"low_risk\",\n            \"reasonable_possibility\": \"high_risk\",\n            \"more_likely_than_not\": \"high_risk\"\n        },\n        \"some_impact\": {\n            \"remote\": \"low_risk\",\n            \"reasonable_possibility\": \"medium_risk\",\n            \"more_likely_than_not\": \"high_risk\"\n        },\n        \"minimal_impact\": {\n            \"remote\": \"low_risk\",\n            \"reasonable_possibility\": \"low_risk\",\n            \"more_likely_than_not\": \"low_risk\"\n        }\n    }\n}\nThe above matrix shows a structured way to assess risk. Your organisation may use a different method you can adapt for the same purpose.\nYou may also want to consider your own corporate risks, such as the impact of regulatory action, reputational damage or loss of public trust.", "type": "Document"}}
