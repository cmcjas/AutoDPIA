You can outsource your DPIA, but you remain responsible for it. If you have a Data Protection Officer (DPO), you must ask for their advice on your DPIA, and document it as part of the process.\nYou may want to ask a processor to carry out a DPIA on your behalf if they do the relevant processing operation, but again you remain responsible for it.\nWho should be involved in the DPIA?\nAs well as the business area or individual who is leading on the project or process requiring the DPIA, you should also involve:\n* a DPO, if you have one;\n* information security staff;\n* any processors; and\n* legal advisors or other experts, where relevant.\n\nWhat is the role of the DPO?      \nIf you have a DPO, you must seek their advice. The DPO should provide advice on:\n* whether you need to do a DPIA;\n* how you should do a DPIA;\n* whether to outsource the DPIA or do it in-house;\n* what measures and safeguards you can take to mitigate risks;\n* whether youve done the DPIA correctly; and\n* the outcome of the DPIA and whether the processing can go ahead.\nYou should record your DPOs advice on the DPIA. If you dont follow their advice, you should record your reasons and ensure you can justify your decision.\nDPOs must also monitor the DPIAs ongoing performance, including how well you have implemented your planned actions to address the risks.\nUnder Article 39 of UKGDPR, DPOs have specific tasks regarding DPIAs. This is why you must ensure that any responsibilities you give a DPO for your DPIA do not conflict with their ability to complete these tasks in an independent manner, as required by Recital 97.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "chatData"}, "type": "Document"}}
