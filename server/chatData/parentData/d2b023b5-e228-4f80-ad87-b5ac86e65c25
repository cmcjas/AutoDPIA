For example:\n* deciding not to collect certain types of data;\n* reducing the scope of the processing;\n* reducing retention periods;\n* taking additional technological security measures;\n* training staff to ensure risks are anticipated and managed;\n* anonymising or pseudonymising data where possible;\n* writing internal guidance or processes to avoid risks;\n* using a different technology;\n* putting clear data-sharing agreements into place;\n* making changes to privacy notices;\n* offering individuals the chance to opt out where appropriate; or\n* implementing new systems to help individuals to exercise their rights.\nThis is not an exhaustive list, and you may be able to devise other ways to help reduce or avoid the risks. You should ask your DPO for advice.\nRecord whether the measure would reduce or eliminate the risk. You can take into account the costs and benefits of each measure when deciding whether or not they are appropriate.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "chatData"}, "type": "Document"}}
