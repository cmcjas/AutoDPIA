It is based onguidelinesadopted by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) on DPIAs (WP248rev01). Our list therefore complements and further specifies these guidelines.\nFor illustration, we have also included examples of existing areas of application. These should not be taken as definitive or exhaustive. In any event, this list does not affect your overriding obligation in Article 35(1), which is to assess any proposed processing operation against the requirement to complete DPIAs. The ICO also considers it best practice to do a DPIA, whether or not the processing is likely to result in a high risk.\nType of processing operation(s) requiring a DPIA\nDescription\nNon-exhaustive examples of existing areas of application\nInnovative technology\nProcessing involving the use of new technologies, or the novel application of existing technologies (including AI).\nA DPIA is required for any intended processing operation(s) involving innovative use of technologies (or applying new technological and/or organisational solutions) when combined with any other criterion from WP248rev01.\n* Artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning\n* Connected and autonomous vehicles\n* Intelligent transport systems\n* Smart technologies\n(including wearables)\n* Market research involving neuro-measurement (i.e. emotional response analysis and brain activity)\n* Some IoT applications, depending on the specific circumstances of the processing", "type": "Document"}}
