A single assessment may address a set of similar processing operations that present similar high risks.\nWhat does high risk mean?\nRisk in this context is about the potential for any significant physical, material or non-material harm to individuals. SeeWhat is a DPIA?for more information on the nature of the risk.\nTo assess whether something is high risk, the UK GDPR is clear that you need to consider both the likelihood and severity of any potential harm to individuals. Risk implies a more than remote chance of some harm. High risk implies a higher threshold, either because the harm is more likely, or because the potential harm is more severe, or a combination of the two. Assessing the likelihood of risk in that sense is part of the job of a DPIA.\nHowever, the question for these initial screening purposes is whether the processing isof a type likely to result ina high risk.", "type": "Document"}}
