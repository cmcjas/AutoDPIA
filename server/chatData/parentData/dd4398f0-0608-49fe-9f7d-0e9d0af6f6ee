The DPO guidelines say that systematic means that the processing:\n* occurs according to a system;\n* is pre-arranged, organised or methodical;\n* takes place as part of a general plan for data collection; or\n* is carried out as part of a strategy.\nThe term extensive implies that the processing also covers a large area, involves a wide range of data or affects a large number of individuals.\nWhat does significantly affect mean?\nThe UKGDPR does not define the concept of a legal or similarly significant effect. However, Article 29 working-party guidelines on this phrase in the context of profiling provisions give some further guidance.\nIn short, it is something that has a noticeable impact on an individual and can significantly affect their circumstances, behaviour or choices.\nA legal effect is something that affects a persons legal status or legal rights. A similarly significant effect might include something that affects a persons financial status, health, reputation, access to services or other economic or social opportunities.\nDecisions that have little impact generally could still significantly affect more vulnerable people, such as children.", "type": "Document"}}
