For example:\n* deciding not to collect certain types of data;\n* reducing the scope of the processing;\n* reducing retention periods;\n* taking additional technological security measures;\n* training staff to ensure risks are anticipated and managed;\n* anonymising or pseudonymising data where possible;\n* writing internal guidance or processes to avoid risks;\n* using a different technology;\n* putting clear data-sharing agreements into place;\n* making changes to privacy notices;\n* offering individuals the chance to opt out where appropriate; or\n* implementing new systems to help individuals to exercise their rights.\nThis is not an exhaustive list, and you may be able to devise other ways to help reduce or avoid the risks. You should ask your DPO for advice.\nRecord whether the measure would reduce or eliminate the risk. You can take into account the costs and benefits of each measure when deciding whether or not they are appropriate.\n\nStep 7: How do we conclude our DPIA?\nYou should then record:\n* what additional measures you plan to take;\n* whether each risk has been eliminated, reduced, or accepted;\n* the overall level of residual risk after taking additional measures; and\n* whether you need to consult the ICO.\nYou do not always have to eliminate every risk. You may decide that some risks, and even a high risk, are acceptable given the benefits of the processing and the difficulties of mitigation. However, if there is still a high risk, you need to consult the ICO before you can go ahead with the processing.\nAs part of the sign-off process, you should seek and document DPO advice on whether the processing is compliant and can go ahead. If you decide not to follow their advice, you need to record your reasons.\nYou should also record any reasons for going against the views of individuals or other consultees.\nWhat happens next?\nYou must integrate the outcomes of your DPIA into your project plans. You should identify any action points and who is responsible for implementing them. You can use the usual project-management process to ensure these are followed through.\nYou should monitor the ongoing performance of the DPIA. You may need to cycle through the process again before your plans are finalised.", "type": "Document"}}
