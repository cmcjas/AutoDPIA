The DPO should provide advice on:\n* whether you need to do a DPIA;\n* how you should do a DPIA;\n* whether to outsource the DPIA or do it in-house;\n* what measures and safeguards you can take to mitigate risks;\n* whether youve done the DPIA correctly; and\n* the outcome of the DPIA and whether the processing can go ahead.\nYou should record your DPOs advice on the DPIA. If you dont follow their advice, you should record your reasons and ensure you can justify your decision.\nDPOs must also monitor the DPIAs ongoing performance, including how well you have implemented your planned actions to address the risks.\nUnder Article 39 of UKGDPR, DPOs have specific tasks regarding DPIAs. This is why you must ensure that any responsibilities you give a DPO for your DPIA do not conflict with their ability to complete these tasks in an independent manner, as required by Recital 97.\n\nStep 1: How do we decide whether to do a DPIA?\nAsk your DPO for advice. If you have any major project that involves the use of personal data, it is good practice to do a DPIA. If you already intend to do a DPIA, go straight to step 2.\nOtherwise, you need to check whether your processing is on the list of types of processing that automatically require a DPIA. If not, you need to screen for other factors that may indicate it is a type of processing that is likely to result in high risk, such as processing the data of vulnerable individuals.\nYou can use or adapt thechecklistsat the end of this guidance to help you do this screening. You can also read When do we need to do a DPIA?for more guidance.\nIf you do this screening and decide a DPIA is not needed, you should document your decision and the reasons for it, including your DPOs advice. This does not have to be a burdensome paperwork exercise. It just needs to help you demonstrate you have properly considered and complied with your DPIA obligations. For example, you could simply keep an annotated copy of the checklist.\nIf you are in any doubt, we strongly recommend you do a DPIA.", "type": "Document"}}
