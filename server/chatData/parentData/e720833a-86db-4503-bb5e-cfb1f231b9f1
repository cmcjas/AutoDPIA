It will help you consider how best to mitigate the impact on individuals ability to exercise control over their data, and whether you can take other measures to support the exercise of their rights. It will also help you demonstrate how you comply with fairness and transparency requirements.\nWhat does vulnerable individual mean?\nIndividuals can be vulnerable where circumstances may restrict their ability to freely consent or object to the processing of their personal data, or to understand its implications.\nMost obviously, children are regarded as vulnerable to the processing of their personal data since they may be less able to understand how their data is being used, anticipate how this might affect them, and protect themselves against any unwanted consequences. This can also be true of other vulnerable sections of the population such as elderly people, or those with certain disabilities.\nEven if the individuals are not part of a group you might automatically consider vulnerable, an imbalance of power in their relationship with you can cause vulnerability for data protection purposes if they believe that they will be disadvantaged if the processing doesnt go ahead.\nOne group who may count as vulnerable in this sense are employees. TheEuropean guidelines on DPIAs (WP248)explain why employees could be considered vulnerable data subjects where a power imbalance means they cannot easily consent or object to the processing of their data by an employer. This type of vulnerability could also arise due to an individuals financial situation (e.g. credit rating) or the specific context of the processing (e.g. patients receiving medical care).", "metadata": {"doc_id": "chatData"}, "type": "Document"}}
