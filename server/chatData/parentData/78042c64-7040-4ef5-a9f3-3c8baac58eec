If you think your processing will involve vulnerable individuals, then a DPIA will be required should any of the other criteria, or operations on our list, be engaged.\nExample\nA sales firm provides company cars for their employees, and intends to deploy vehicles with location-tracking features, allowing managers to monitor the movement and whereabouts of their employees at all times. Employees are also permitted to use the vehicles for their private purposes outside working hours.\nThe processing intends to track each individuals geolocation, in a context where they are vulnerable to a power imbalance with the controller. So this engages the requirement for a DPIA to identify and mitigate the risks to the employees rights and freedoms.\nWhat does large scale mean?\nAgain, the UKGDPR does not contain a definition of large-scale processing, but to decide whether processing is on a large scale you should consider:\n* the number of individuals concerned;\n* the volume of data;\n* the variety of data;\n* the duration of the processing; and\n* the geographical extent of the processing.\nExamples of large-scale processing include:\n* a hospital (but not an individual doctor) processing patient data;\n* tracking individuals using a citys public transport system;\n* a fast food chain tracking real-time location of its customers;\n* an insurance company or bank processing customer data;\n* a search engine processing data for behavioural advertising; or\n* a telephone or internet service provider processing user data.\nIndividual professionals processing patient or client data are not processing on a large scale.\nAre there any exceptions?\nYou may not have to carry out a DPIA if:\n* You are processing on the basis of legal obligation or public task.However, this exception only applies if:\n* you are not subject to other obligations to complete DPIAs derived from specific legislation, such as Digital Economy Act 2017;\n* you have a clear statutory basis for the processing;\n* the legal provision or a statutory code specifically provides for and regulates the processing operation in question; and", "type": "Document"}}
