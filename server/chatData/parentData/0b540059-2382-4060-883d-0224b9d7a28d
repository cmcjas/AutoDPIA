This can also be true of other vulnerable sections of the population such as elderly people, or those with certain disabilities.\nEven if the individuals are not part of a group you might automatically consider vulnerable, an imbalance of power in their relationship with you can cause vulnerability for data protection purposes if they believe that they will be disadvantaged if the processing doesnt go ahead.\nOne group who may count as vulnerable in this sense are employees. TheEuropean guidelines on DPIAs (WP248)explain why employees could be considered vulnerable data subjects where a power imbalance means they cannot easily consent or object to the processing of their data by an employer. This type of vulnerability could also arise due to an individuals financial situation (e.g. credit rating) or the specific context of the processing (e.g. patients receiving medical care).", "type": "Document"}}
